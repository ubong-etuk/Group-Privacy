# Group-Privacy Analysis
This research presents PriSAT as a tool developed for investigating group privacy. The tool is typically designed for analyzing privacy satisfaction in software design. It is implemented in Java programming language and utilizes an epistemic modal logic approach for privacy analysis. The PriSAT tool allows for various forms of privacy analyses, one of which is the group privacy requirements analysis. The following six steps are required in using the PriSAT tool to analyze the extent to which a given group of interacting users satisfies a specific instance of  privacy requirements for the group. 

**Step 1**: Start the tool. This displays the different interfaces that constitute the tool. 
**Step 2**:  Configure the group under consideration (see example in  Figure 	\ref{pstep2} ). This involves generating an interaction network of users and assigning disclosure protocols to each interact between the users in the network.
**Step 3**: Generate instances of the group privacy requirements. This step involves selecting the type of group privacy requirement to investigate (instance-based or role-base) and generating the possible instances of that requirement type.
