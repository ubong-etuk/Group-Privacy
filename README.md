# Group-Privacy Analysis
This research presents PriSAT as a tool developed for investigating group privacy. The tool is typically designed for analyzing privacy satisfaction in software design. It is implemented in Java programming language and utilizes an epistemic modal logic approach for privacy analysis. The PriSAT tool allows for various forms of privacy analyses, one of which is the group privacy requirements analysis. The following six steps are required in using the PriSAT tool to analyze the extent to which a given group of interacting users satisfies a specific instance of  privacy requirements for the group. 

**Step 1**: Start the tool. This displays the different interfaces that constitute the tool.

**Step 2**:  Configure the group under consideration. This involves generating an interaction network of users and assigning disclosure protocols to each interact between the users in the network.
**Step 3**: Generate instances of the group privacy requirements. This step involves selecting the type of group privacy requirement to investigate (instance-based or role-base) and generating the possible instances of that requirement type. 

**Step 4**: Select the instance of the privacy requirements. This involves selecting the specific requirements instance(s) from the state space of instances generated in Step 3 for analysis. 

**Step 5**: Verify the privacy requirements satisfaction . This step initiates the analysis that determines the extent the configured group in Step 1 satisfies the selected instance of privacy requirements in Step 4.

**Step 6**:  Display the requirements satisfaction outcome (see example in  Figure	\ref{pstep6} ). This step displays the outcome of requirements satisfaction using the sat tree to highlight the sat outcome of each assertion in the selected requirements.
